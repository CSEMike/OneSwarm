/**
 * Encapsulates per-type resource generation logic. This type is used only by
 * developers who wish to add additional resource types to the resource
 * generation system. Implementations are paired with one or more interfaces
 * derived from ResourcePrototype that have been annotated with an
 * {@link ResourceGeneratorType} annotation. Instances of ResourceGenerator must
 * support default-instantiation (i.e. via {@link Class#newInstance()}).
 * <p>
 * The methods on an instance of ResourceGenerator will be called in the
 * following order by the resource generation system:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #init}</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #prepare} once for each method</li>
 * <li>Based on the requirements specified by the ResourceGenerator, the
 * framework may decide that no further action is required. If this is the case,
 * the framework will immediately invoke {@link #finish}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #createFields}</li>
 * <li>{@link #createAssignment} once for each method</li>
 * <li>{@link #finish}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link #prepare} and {@link #createAssignment} will be called
 * only with those methods whose ResourcePrototype-derived type specifies the
 * particular type of ResourceGenerator as the implementor. The relative order
 * in which ResourceGenerators are invoked and the specific order in which the
 * bundle's methods are presented is undefined.
 * <p>
 * Direct access to the contents of the generated bundle implementation is
 * intentionally limited to prevent unrelated ResourceGenerators from
 * potentially creating namespace conflicts or generating invalid Java source.
