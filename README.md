# Building

* By default, Ant is limited to ~64 MB of memory, which will be exhausted when compiling OneSwarm. Increase your Ant memory, e.g., `export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx256m"`
* The OneSwarm build script, `build.xml`, depends on [ant-contrib](http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/). If you're on OSX or Linux, this is usually easy to install using your favorite package manager.
